# Welcome, comrades! Glory to the People’s Republic of China! 

Lmaoism is a Web3 net-art project conceptualized with the mission of educating and informing the masses on the philosophies of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism, Communism with Chinese Characteristics, and Xi Jinping Thought. Our collection of 888 limited-edition digital paintings combine socialist realist iconography from the historical revolutionary mass-media campaigns of the  Communist Party of China with contemporary digital art motifs in the style of today’s twenty-first-century online youth. 

We on the Lmaoism team believe that to express laughter and exuberance is to embrace the revolutionary spirit of dialectical materialism when experienced at its highest potential - though the revolutionary has a difficult road ahead of him, strewn with the foulest of obstacles flung in his path by the bourgeois-reactionary enemy, he nevertheless joyfully wages struggle on behalf of the global proletariat, secured by the justice of his cause, and the certainity of imperialist-capitalism’s inevitable defeat. 

## How will the art be distributed? 

(fill this out when we settle on something)

## Isn’t cryptocurrency a capitalist invention? Is it counter to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to sell digital art for profit?

While it is undeniable that the novel digital technology of blockchain and Web3 has been vulgarly exploited as a site for the most grotesque expressions of capitalist greed (as is the case with all technology placed into the hands of the bankers, politicans, and generals of the imperialist-capitalist West), a properly dialectical Marxist-Leninist perspective will inform us that the same method of production which has been used to trample, oppress, and injure the proletariat can take on a revolutionary character when seized from the hands of the powerful capitalist interests and enlivened with the abundant spirits of working people. 

We will do well to reflect on the immortal wisdom of Vladimir Lenin, when he told us: *"They [the capitalists] will furnish credits which will serve us for the support of the Communist Party in their countries and, by supplying us materials and technical equipment which we lack, will restore our military industry necessary for our future attacks against our suppliers. To put it in other words, they will work on the preparation of their own suicide."* The capitalist only understands the language of profit, and as such, he will sell the revolutionary workers the rope they will use to hang him with, thus securing his inevitable downfall. 

In this, we obey democratic centralism by holding to the official line of the Communist Party of China, who have launched the parallel initiatives of the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) and the digital RMB (Yuan) for the sake of developing the productive apparatuses of the People’s Republic of China, in accordance with the long-term development goals laid out by Xi Jinping and the philosophy of Communism with Chinese Characteristics. 

The digital art pieces in the Lmaoism collection are intended to be investment assets that will increase in value when held in the hands of representatives of the global proletariat, who will have the ability to purchase the art in a mass sale without any of the historic barriers to entry and class stratification seen in the typically bourgeious-fascist Western contemporary art world. As the pieces accrue in value (which will occur as a result of the increasingly dominant geopolitical position of the People’s Republic of China and the further education of the masses on Xi Jinping Thought), the representatives of the global proletariat in possession of the art will thus acquire increased access to material resources for revolutionary practice, thus allowing us to “LMAO” as we seize the ability to triumph over the capitalists simply by playing their own devious game. 

## Will purchasing art from Lmaoism contribute to global warming or other negative effects on the climate?

It is of insurmountable importance for any project of a revolutionary character to consider the effects of industrial production on the natural environment: as this is the soil the peasants farm upon, the water the peasants drink, the air the peasants breathe, and moreover the cradle in which a revolutionary spirit can be nutured among the masses.

Critics of Web3 technology often fail to appreciate the crucial difference between two methods  of securing a blockchain network: 

- Proof-of-work: A wasteful, environmentally-degrading process of channeling electricity through large assemblages of specialized hardware (commonly known as “mining”) 

- Proof-of-stake: Use of online voting among a set of representatives (analogous to decision-making in a Marxist-Leninist Politburo or a capitalist governance board)

The glory, justice, and swift decision-making of the People’s Republic of China leadership can be seen in their decision of December 2021 to bring the full fury of the revolutionary state upon the reactionary-fascist elements in the population contributing to environmental degradation through selfish proof-of-work Bitcoin “mining”, with over twenty-five such operations in Sichaun province alone shuttered and trampled under the heel of the onward-marching proletariat. Following the example of the revolutionary state, Web3 users of a communist character cannot and should not tolerate this similar activity amongst their ranks. 

However, conversely, comrades who lazily conflate the two divergent forms of network security after a failure to investigate the differences between the two modes of production should be brought to self-criticism for their ignorance. As Mao Zedong said, “No investigation, no right to speak!” 

Therefore, following these considerations, Lmaoism will be distrubted on Polygon, a **proof-of-stake** Layer 2 network built upon Ethereum, and as such can be minted and traded without malignant effects on the climate. 

## What are the long-term goals of Lmaoism? 

Disseminating digital artworks of a socialist realist character, while an important revolutionary task in itself, will be only the initial cusp of the Lmaoism project. Our goal is to develop the **world’s first fully-digital revolutionary Communist Party** entirely on the blockchain, the uncensorable internationally-accessible nature of which will allow our ideals to rapidly disseminate amongst the globally online proletariat. DAO technology can allow shared ownership of revolutionary resources trustlessly coordinated by a central committe, which can be delegated to comrades across the globe based on the philosopy of Karl Marx & Fredrick Engels: “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need!”. 

We are researching ways to incorporate “code is law” philosophy into Marxist-Leninist practices such as the mass line, democratic centralism, and self-criticism. Through the use of trustless technology, we can further the discipline amongst party ranks and ensure an unyielding revolutionary spirit of solidarity as we wage our immortal struggle against imperialism and the oppressive institutions which heretofore have ignobly shackled us in chains.
